            I am excited to kick off my campaign for City Council. Thank you to
            all the people who supported me when I ran 2 years ago. I am running
            to work for you to protect open space, create multi use paths and
            trails, protect our air and water and make Heber City a safer and
            better place today and for future generations. Here is what I wrote
            for my campaign summary for the ballot:
          </p>
          <p class="mb-4">
            As a City Council member, I will work to protect open space,
            preserve clean air, and keep our water safe. We must grow
            responsibly by aligning our zoning ordinances with the general plan
            to preserve the majority of our natural lands as accessible open
            space.
            <br />
            <b>Open Space</b> – Follow Midway’s example and place a bond on the ballot
            to fund conservation easements and land purchases for preservation.
            <br />
            <b>Clean Air</b> – Expand mass transit and improve safety for walking,
            biking, and bus travel. Like Evanston, we should lower speed limits on
            side streets to 20 mph.
            <br />
            <b>Clean Water</b> – Strengthen our sensitive lands ordinance to better
            protect drainage areas and require developers to preserve more native
            vegetation.
            <br />
            <b>Responsible Growth</b> – Focus on building up, not out. Encourage
            clustered development and higher density downtown while protecting native
            habitats. Developers should be required to include multi-use paths and
            bus stops when installing roads and utilities.
            <br />
            <b>Community</b> – Continue the work of the current council by upgrading
            Main Street Park, creating more parks, and connecting the city with multi-use
            paths. I am committed to working with all citizens of Heber City to make
            living here better now and for future generations I want to expand on
            each of these concepts, why I think they are important and how we can
            go about getting the changes we want to happen.
          </p>

          <p class="mb-4">
            I want to expand on the first 2 concepts in this blog post why I
            think they are important and how we can go about getting the changes
            we want to happen.

            council, Mayor Heidi Franco and others for all the work that went into
            making that happen.
          </p>

          <p class="mb-4">
            I plan to work closely with local land owners, the county, the state
            and the federal government and other organizations to protect open
            space. The best time to buy or conserver land was 20 years ago. The
            next best time is now.

            2. Clean Air / Safe Transportation - You can see the inversion more
            and more every year creeping into Heber Valley. The negative effects
            of air pollution are <a
              href="https://www.epa.gov/air-research/research-health-effects-air-pollution"
              target="_blank"
              class="text-blue-600 hover:text-blue-800 underline"
              rel="noopener noreferrer">well documented</a
            > leading to increased incidences of respiratory issues, cardiovascular
            disease, and neurological problems. We need to expand mass transit and
            improve safety for walking, biking, and bus travel to reduce the number
            of cars on the road. Electrifying our homes for heating and cooking is
            another way to reduce air pollution. As a city council we can help by
            providing education and work closely with Heber Light and Power. I personally
            have heat pumps in my home and I love them. They are quiet, efficient,
            and cost effective great at cooling in the summer and heating in the
            winter. As a side note Heber light and power is switching everyone to
            time of use rates next year. I think everyone should prepare to see their
            electricity rates almost double. It might be cost effective to install
            solar panels and batteries, as the costs have come down significantly
            over the last few years.
          </p>

          <p class="mb-4">
            Safety: We are well aware of the dangers of driving in Heber Valley.
            Too many times children have been hit by cars just trying to get to
            school or to lunch. Duchesne has lowered the speed limit of highway
            40 in their downtown to 30 mph. I wonder if UDOT would consider
            allowing us to do the same, especially after the bypass gets built.
            Like Evanston, we could lower speed limits on side streets to 20
            mph. We need to make Heber a safe place to walk and bike. Making
            sure we have separate bike lanes and better designed intersections.
            We have a great master trail plan that we should be working to
            implement now
